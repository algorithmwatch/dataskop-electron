This project was kickstarted with [Electron React Boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate/).
Electron React Boilerplate uses <a href="https://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a>, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>, <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/redux">Redux</a>, <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-router">React Router</a>, <a href="https://webpack.github.io/docs/">Webpack</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader">React Hot Loader</a> for rapid application development (HMR).

## Installation

- **If you have installation or compilation issues with this project, please see [our debugging guide](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/400)**

First, clone the repo via git and install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Development

Start the app in the `dev` environment. This starts the renderer process in [**hot-module-replacement**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/) mode and starts a webpack dev server that sends hot updates to the renderer process:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Packaging for Production

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
yarn package
```
